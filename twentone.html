    <p>This was a very mixed year in my life cos it started very similarly to the end of 2020 but ended very differently.
        When i started this year i was waiting for my university application and sorting out all the small details with it.
         Honestly it wasn't too eventful because of that. I was really worried about starting university as it was a new experience 
         but it also was a fresh start. During this time i also was going a bit mad with purchases because of my universal credit 
         which i gave some to my parents and used the rest for myself until August while also looking for work to pass the time until i started. 
         Otherwise though it felt like 2020 as the UK was in lockdown for a good few months. (I wasnâ€™t actually too sure on this).
    </p>

        Once September rolled around i started university and this was horrifying for like a little while. 
        I was leaving home behind for a period of time and that's not fun. However i met a lot of people who helped ease this. 
        Not only that but i just wasn't that scared after a little bit. I really enjoyed living by myself and just doing things according to my own schedule.
        Around this time i was also waiting on a really important order which i never got. Which was a Dress i had no intention on not privately experimenting with my gender.
        I felt i had to because there was no other way for me to do this. I ordered the dress just before i came to uni and therefore it couldn't get delivered.
        Luckily i found and bought another one.
