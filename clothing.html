    <p>Clothing is quite important to me and has been a very fun part of my transition process. I have over the last few years bought a lot of clothes and unfortunately had to get rid of some. A lot of my clothes over the last year or so has been bought second hand through Vinted and through Charity Shops. Something really important I’ve used is a service called TIN Wardrobe which is a charity that receives donations and posts them on their Instagram for trans people to reserve and get sent for free. During 2021 and the early part of 22 I did buy clothes new mostly through Amazon which were nice but a lot of these had to be gotten rid of.

        A lot of my clothes are dresses both shorter ones and longer ones. I do have 4 skirts which I can wear under a dress or by themselves though recently I’ve been wearing them under my dresses. It’s comfortable to do that especially if my skirt on the dress is really thin and it keeps me warmer. Normally I do wear stuff underneath my dress like a vest or a bralette. These are comfortable to wear too and work better than using a t-shirt which I used to do. A lot of my fashion decisions are about style and comfort. Being comfortable in my outfits is probably the most important thing for me.
