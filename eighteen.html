    <p>This was the year I came out. Kind of the most important thing really of this year. This was all started by being around trans people online on discord and twitter. This caused some thoughts about my own gender but nothing too huge. I did experiment with my identity a little bit, but it wasn’t anything I shared at all, and it wasn’t too important. Until about a week into my sixth form education where something just kind of clicked with me. I call it getting hit by a truck because it felt like it. My entire view of myself was permanently changed. I can’t remember the exact date, but it was a Sunday when it happened and then on the Monday, I went out for a walk to my local train station, as it was far and I didn’t want to be in the house and discussed it with myself all the stuff that was important to me. At this point I wasn’t too sure on names, but I had some in mind including Ivy obviously and on that Monday or the Tuesday I cannot remember the granular detail here I came out to people I know. It was terrifying but I did both online to a lot of lovely people I still know and someone who I lost contact with not too long afterwards unfortunately. I did try and come out to my parents but it went very strangely and I am still not really out to them.  A lot of the rest of that year was just a feeling of magic as my life just felt so different and I wasn’t stuck as who I was and I became a bit more happy.
