<p> Hi! My name is Ivy Moss, and this website is made to help other transgender people by telling my story regarding coming out and the 5 years since then. 
    Thisâ€™ll cover Sixth Form, COVID-19, and University. Also on this website will be some clothing advice like where I get my clothes from and some galleries showing these off. 
    This is the main home page for the website along the side you can find links to the years and on the top left there's a home button to come back here.
    </p>

    <p> 
        DISCLAIMER: The infomation here is based on my memory of each year so there may be some parts i am misremembering or omitting.
        Omissions may be made because they contain infomation on location or something i'm not willing to share. 
    </p>
