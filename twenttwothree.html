    <p>These two years have been very similar for me much like 2019-20 honestly. These two years have been me reaching out and doing more stuff with other LGBT people as I went out and joined my university’s LGBT society. This has been a very fun experience overall. There was a very big contrast between the start of 2022 and the end of 2022 as I went back home in the summer which halted anything I could do as I’m not out to my family.  

        During this period, I also started taking a lot more pictures of myself as it really helped me with getting more confidence in my appearance. In fact, during a lot of 2023, I took a picture every day to post online via Instagram. This has been very helpful during my process as it helps to show how i'm doing each day and it's simply fun to do. I would never recommend it as it is deeply personal but i enjoy it.
