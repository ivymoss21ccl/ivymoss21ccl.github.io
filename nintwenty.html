    <p> Not much really happened during these two years honestly in 2019 i turned 18 at least which was fun. 
        2019 was very much a strange year because i felt that i didn't really aid in my transition i wasn’t out to anyone in person only online and i kind of had to deal with that for the year.
        It's kind of hard looking back on 2019 under this lense because i did some cool things like i went to the cinema a lot to watch films due to having a free bus pass and a lot of birthday money.
        However it just wasn’t really much of anything. After coming out this year was a struggle and i also in the second half of it had to start thinking about my future.

    </p>

    <p> Talking about the future 2020 happened i don't feel i need to go into this very much honestly with the COVID-19 pandemic happening this put any slight progress i had in 2019 to a screeching halt. 
        My sixth form experience was over and i was isolating like so many were. At home so i just couldn't do anything. 
        When my most important memory of 2020 personally was signing up for university independently and signing up for universal credit well there's not much to say. It was an awful year for me and i felt trapped in a way i never had before both personally and in general.
